# ts-playground
Lightweight boilerplate for toying with TypeScript. Useful for prototyping. 

1. `npm run deps`
2. `npm run start` in the root to run server & client watchers concurrently, or respectively `cd client && npm run start`, `cd server && npm run start`.
3. http://localhost:3030

## Features
* TS on server / client
* ghetto HMR in the browser
* server auto-restarts on changes
* source maps in the browser


## Todos
* make server code decent
* extract common deps to root 
* make sourcemaps work properly
* test scaffolding
* module bundling?
